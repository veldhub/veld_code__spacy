          that directly into the yaml file but rather define the environment variable yourself, 
          before calling this docker compose service. On linux and mac, this can be done with 
          `export hf_token=<TOKEN>` before launching a docker compose service, or persist it in a
          `.env` (with the content simply being `hf_token=<TOKEN>`) file next to the chain veld 
          yaml file, where docker compose would load it from (take care to not commit that to git! 
          Best to add the `.env` to `.gitignore`)."
