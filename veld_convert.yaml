    description: "prepare data for spacy NER training, since spacy expects the entity annotation
      indices to be precisely at the beginning and end of the words, and also no overlapping
      entity annotations. Then it converts the data to spaCy docbin, and prepares it for training
      by splitting it into train, dev, eval subsets, and shuffling them randomly."
